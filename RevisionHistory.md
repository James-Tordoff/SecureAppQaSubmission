<span style="color:orange;">All work must be checked in every day with out fail and multiple times per day depending on quantity of work being done within a project. It does not matter if code is finished if you leave a project you must check-in code to ensure when you return to the code you/or another can pick up from your notes what stage the current branch is in.</span>
